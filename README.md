# Antigen: Epidemiological Simulation Framework

Antigen is a powerful simulation framework for studying virus evolution and population dynamics in epidemiological contexts. Built for researchers in infectious disease epidemiology, it implements SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models with genetic and phenotypic evolution of pathogens.

## ü¶† What Antigen Does

- **Models virus evolution**: Simulate how viruses evolve over time with antigenic drift and immune escape
- **Population dynamics**: Track infections across structured populations with multiple demes/regions
- **Immune history**: Model host immunity based on past infection history and cross-immunity
- **Phylogenetic tracking**: Generate virus genealogies and sample phylogenetic trees
- **Flexible phenotypes**: Support multiple phenotype models (geometric, sequence-based)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 16 or higher
- Maven (recommended) or manual Java compilation

### Installation & Basic Run
```bash
# Clone and navigate to directory
git clone https://github.com/matsengrp/antigen.git
cd antigen

# Compile with Maven
mvn clean compile package

# Run simulation (basic)
java -jar target/antigen-prime.jar

# Run with more memory for larger simulations
java -jar target/antigen-prime.jar -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xmx8G
```

### Your First Simulation
The simulation will run with default parameters and create output files in the `output/` directory:
- `out.timeseries` - Epidemic curves and prevalence over time
- `out.tips` - Sampled virus genetic and antigenic data  
- `out.branches` - Phylogenetic relationships between samples
- `out.summary` - Summary statistics

<!-- ## üî¨ Research Applications

Antigen is designed for epidemiological research questions such as:
- **Seasonal influenza dynamics**: Model antigenic drift and vaccine effectiveness
- **Multi-strain competition**: Study how different virus strains compete and evolve
- **Population structure effects**: Analyze how geographic structure affects spread
- **Immune history impact**: Understand how past infections shape future disease risk
- **Vaccination strategies**: Evaluate intervention timing and coverage -->

## üí° Key Features

### Epidemiological Model
- **SIR dynamics** with recovered immunity based on antigenic similarity
- **Multi-deme populations** with configurable migration rates
- **Seasonal transmission** patterns with region-specific parameters
- **Host demographics** including birth, death, and aging processes

### Virus Evolution
- **Antigenic phenotypes** in continuous n-dimensional space or sequence-based
- **Mutation models** with epitope/non-epitope site differences
- **Phylogenetic tracking** of virus genealogies throughout simulation
- **Cross-immunity** based on antigenic distance between strains

## üìä Example Output

Running the default simulation generates epidemiological timeseries showing:
- Regional infection prevalence and incidence
- Virus sampling and genetic diversity
- Phylogenetic relationships between circulating strains
- Summary statistics of key epidemiological parameters
